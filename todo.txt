FIXED: TODO: When a module has more than 1 sub-song it will go to next

  I think in random play mode it should only play first song, since some have quite a 
  few and most sub-songs are then short sound effects.

FIXED: GFX GLITCH
- minify window with RMB+Pr
--> top part of favorites button is visible

FIXED: SCOPE BUG: activation
- the scope works in multimonitor support as long as ALL modules that are played
  support it. Once a module that doesn't support the scope is loaded
  the next module that supports it does not enable it anymore.
  So if you play modules in random order as soon as a 
  module that doesn't support visualization is played the scope
  stops working all together (until you click on the scope of course).

- Now that we have multiple monitor support with P96 libraries it is possible to have HippoPlayer playing in its own Native screen and have RTG Workbench active at the same time on the other monitor. But as soon as the Screen on which HippoPlayer is placed is not active anymore the Scopes stop updating, only the timer updates.
Would it be possible to add an option for the Scopes to update at all times regardless if the screen is active or not?
